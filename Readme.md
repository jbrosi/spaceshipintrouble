# Spaceship in Trouble

A small WebGL game written in ThreeJS. It was written in order to demonstrate
the power of WebGL games as they are easy to write, cross plattform and the
performance isn't too bad.

## May I see it in action?

Yes you may! Visit http://jbrosi.github.io/spaceshipintrouble/demo/ for the latest
stable version or visit https://c9.io/jbrosi/spaceshipintrouble/workspace/built.html in order to
run the latest built version. Or just clone the project and build it on your own. If you're interested 
in the code you may browse through https://c9.io/jbrosi/spaceshipintrouble. The game was entirely written
within the cloud9 IDE and you can see the latest updates there.

If you're interested in how this works you should take a look at the apidocs: http://jbrosi.github.io/spaceshipintrouble/api

## What if something doesn't work?

The status of this is pre-alpha yet and there may be several bugs but feel free
to open an issue if you want something to be fixed.

## Did you do this all on your own?

Of course not. I used various libraries, tools and assets...

### Libraries

- ThreeJS
- Lodash
- RequireJS
- Almond
- Stats
- Box2DWeb


### Tools

- Typescript
- Wings3D
- Gimp
- Blender
- Cloud9

### Assets

- Some models from opengameart.org (cco)
- One or more textures on this project have been created with images from Goodtextures.com. These images may not be redistributed by default. Please visit www.goodtextures.com for more information.


## Sounds awesome, may I join?

Sure! Just fork the project, play around with it, create issues for new features and drop me a message if you really
want to add some code or assets.


## That's quite cool, may I use it?

The project is released under the the MIT License (MIT) so you should be able
to use it for almost everything you need. Be careful when using the libraries and
assets as they may fall under other licenses.

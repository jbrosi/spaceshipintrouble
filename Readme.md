# Spaceship in Trouble

A small WebGL game written in ThreeJS. It was written in order to demonstrate
the power of WebGL games as they are easy to write, cross plattform and the
performance isn't too bad.

## May I see it in action?

Yes you may! Visit https://c9.io/jbrosi/spaceshipintrouble/workspace/built.html in order to
run the latest built version. If you're interested in the code you may browse
through https://c9.io/jbrosi/spaceshipintrouble. The game was entirely written
within the cloud9 IDE and you can see the latest updates there.

## What if something doesn't work?

The status of this is pre-alpha yet and there may be several bugs but feel free
to open an issue if you want something to be fixed.

## Did you do this all on your own?

Yes I did - but I used the following libraries:

- ThreeJS
- Lodash
- RequireJS
- Almond
- Stats
- Box2DWeb


## That's quite cool, may I use it?

The project is released under the the MIT License (MIT) so you should be able
to use it for almost everything you need.

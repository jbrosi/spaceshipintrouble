# Spaceship in Trouble

A small WebGL game written in TypeScript, ThreeJS and some other libraries.
It was written in order to demonstrate the power of WebGL games as they are easy to write,
cross plattform and the performance isn't too bad

## May I see it in action?

Yes you may! Checkout the latest [stable version](http://jbrosi.github.io/spaceshipintrouble/demo/) or just clone the
project and build it on your own. If you're interested in the code you'll get the latest commits here in this github repo.
You may also browse through the [Cloud9 Code Repo](https://c9.io/jbrosi/spaceshipintrouble) (could be a few commits outdated)
or watch the [apidocs](http://jbrosi.github.io/spaceshipintrouble/api).

## What if something doesn't work?

The status of this is pre-alpha yet and there may be several bugs but feel free
to open an issue if you want something to be fixed.

## Did you do this all on your own?

Of course not. I used various libraries, tools and assets... The entity / component system is heavily inspired by the
[TTJS Engine](https://github.com/CSchnackenberg/TTjs), a port of the famous TouchThing Engine which
[Christoph Schnackenberg](https://github.com/CSchnackenberg) and I created a few years ago.

### Libraries

- ThreeJS
- Lodash
- RequireJS
- Almond
- Stats
- Box2DWeb


### Tools

- Typescript
- Wings3D
- Gimp
- Blender
- Cloud9
- PHPStorm

### Assets

- Some models from opengameart.org (cco)
- One or more textures on this project have been created with images from Goodtextures.com. These images may not be redistributed by default. Please visit www.goodtextures.com for more information.


## Sounds awesome, may I join?

Sure! Just fork the project, play around with it, create issues for new features and drop me a message if you really
want to add some code or assets.


## That's quite cool, may I use it?

The project is released under the the MIT License (MIT) so you should be able
to use it for almost everything you need. Be careful when using the libraries and
assets as they may fall under other licenses.


## Some parts look more like an engine than an actual game, do they?

You got sharp eyes over there. Yep, they do! I plan on separating engine and game later on and use the game
just as an example for how to use the engine. But as of this very early state of the project it's muuuch easier
to have both projects combined in one as there will be lots of api changes.

As soon as the project reaches a more stable status and the api becomes to be more stable, too I'll separate those
two projects. Though both projects will remain under the MIT License. Promise.
